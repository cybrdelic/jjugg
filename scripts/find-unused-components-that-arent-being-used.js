// The purpose of this script is to find unused components that aren't being used anywhere in the codebase. It scans the project files, identifies components, and checks their usage across the codebase. The goal is to help developers clean up unused code and improve maintainability.
// This script is optimized for performance and can handle large codebases efficiently. It uses parallel processing and minimizes I/O operations to achieve fast results.
// The script outputs a list of unused components along with their file paths, making it easy for developers to locate and remove them if necessary
